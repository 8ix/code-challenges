# Code Challenges and Learning Exercises

Welcome to my personal learning repository! ðŸ‘‹

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of code challenges and training exercises that I've been working on to enhance my programming skills. It represents my journey in continuous learning and skill development in software engineering.

## Current Focus

At present, this repository primarily contains examples and exercises in:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript

But over my career I have done plenty more, I plan to expand this to include other languages and technologies as I progress in my learning journey in the future.

## Source of Challenges

Many of the challenges and exercises here are inspired by or sourced from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/), an excellent platform for learning programming through practical challenges. I find that hands-on problem-solving is one of the most effective ways to learn and improve coding skills.

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. Each challenge or exercise here represents a step in my journey to become a better programmer. I'm constantly pushing myself to tackle new problems, explore different approaches, and refine my coding practices.

## For Visitors and Fellow Learners
